# ☀️ Rooftop Solar Potential Analysis App


This is a full-stack web application for analyzing rooftop solar potential using satellite imagery, PV system simulation, and financial/environmental estimations. Users can explore rooftops via interactive maps, detect empty roof space using machine learning, and receive detailed summaries of energy yield, cost, and CO₂ savings.
